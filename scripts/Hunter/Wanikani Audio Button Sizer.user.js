/*
 *  ====  Wanikani Audio Button Sizer  ====
 *    ==    by Hunter Pankey     ==
 *
 *  The button to press to play the audio sample is way too small. It's bounded
 *  by the size of the speaker icon that's displayed by default. This changes it
 *  30x30 pixels with a black border to signify that the clickable/tappable area
 *  is significantly larger.
