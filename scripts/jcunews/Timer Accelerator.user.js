// @description  Accelerates time by decreasing the durations of time for timers, in order to shorten the time to wait for something. This script is intended to be used for decreasing the waiting time for file downloads. This script will only work on download sites which do not track the waiting time from the server, or if the waiting time is not JavaScript driven.
