However Waze retrieves address and POI locations from many third party sources as well (as you can tell by the little icons at the bottom of the search results screen in the client app). \
These primarily come from Google, Bing, Yelp, etc., and when it uses these 3rd party sources it only gets the actual GPS coordinates of the location and not the correct street to attach it to. Waze therefore guesses which street to navigate to based on which is closest to the pin location. \
This sometimes leads to routing around the corner or the block behind where you actually need to be. Unfortunately we can't correct the information in the other sources, but you can go to those respective sites and submit an error report to them asking them to fix it. \
(You can tell if a search result is coming from Waze or Google by checking which icon is highlighted at the bottom of the client app, also the Waze results will NOT include a zip code, the Google results WILL include a zip code.)\r\r\

    "GPS Snapping to Parallel Rd",
    "Unfortunately this is an issue contributed to by several factors including but not limited to poor GPS chip quality in our consumer electronics (phones), poor GPS accuracy due to interference and large buildings and structures, the way Waze 'snaps' you onto the nearest road and resists changing that unless you deviate significantly away from it (further than from the Service Rd to the Main Rd), and Waze assuming you are following the directions and your GPS is slightly off.\r\r\
\
To correct it you can try a few things.\r\
1) Tap the 'Navigate' menu > Routes and choose the best route. When it recalculates it may place you back on the right road.\r\
2) Stop navigation (Menu > Stop Navigation) and then restart Navigation to the same destination. When you are not in navigation mode Waze snaps back to your actual road easier.\r\
3) Exit the app (Menu > power button (|) ), and then just open it back up. When it opens it should see you on the correct road and then a popup should appear asking if you want to continue your last destination. Tap yes and it will resume navigation to your destination from the right road.\r\
4) If the GPS location on the device itself is the problem (if it happens in other apps as well) try turning your GPS antennas off and on again. Make sure as well that your device has a clear view of the sky.\r\r\

If you are a qualified HOV vehicle and want to use the HOV lane, driving into the HOV should force Waze to recalculate your route. Once Waze realizes you are in the HOV lane, it should calculate the best route to your destination allowing you to stay in the HOV lane.

1) Waze thinks there is traffic or an incident up ahead, and is trying to take you around it to save time. This traffic/incident may have already cleared up, but Waze will only know once people start driving through that segment at average speed.\r\
2) Based on historical traffic data for that time of day, Waze thinks that the other route will be faster. The only way to fix this is by people driving both routes and teaching Waze what the correct average speeds on those roads are. If this is always happening at the same place, try and take the suggested route a few times, to show Waze that it really is slower. (I know it's a detour, but it will help everyone in your area.)\r\
3) A Temporary Road Closure was reported along your route. Once enough wazers drive through the closure at highway speed, the closure will be cancelled.\r\
4) It may actually be a faster route. If you follow it once or twice (step 2) you can see for yourself.\r\
