// - Solve problem with multi-parametered links not bypasssing extra parameters
// - [Further Inquiry] Links utilizing a hashbang, and different possible methods of it's existence in a URL 

// AUTHOR'S NOTES
// This would technically work as the best (and simplest) approach, but would require
// that the script run after the page loads the body, which isn't a 
// very pretty way of executing this type of script.

        name = name.replace(/[\[]/, "\\\[").replace(/[\]]/, "\\\]");
        var regex = new RegExp("[\\?&]" + name + "=([^&#]*)"),
            results = regex.exec(location.search);

// This segment used to be a half-assed approach at solving a problem that exists in
// in JS. MEGA's links use a hashbang (#!) for it's links to provide an id and access
// key for their files. JS tends to parse the hashbang as a specific hash, no matter
// where it finds it in the URL. Since in the case of steam's linkfilter, it isn't
// particularly a hash, but JS doesn't know that and places it under window.location.hash
// anyway.
//
//    if (filteredLink == "https://mega.co.nz/") {
//        var filteredLink = filteredLink + window.location.hash;
//    }

// I'm not sure if you'd call this a less half-assed approach or simply a full-assed
// approach at the problem, but instead of looking for MEGA links specifically, it instead
// looks for links which contain a hashbang, and append them to the base URL which the
// initial function found. Obviously, this is working on the assumption that links with a
// hashbang would be in a format which mirrors that of MEGA's (e.g. http[s]://[domain]/[Hashbang token])
