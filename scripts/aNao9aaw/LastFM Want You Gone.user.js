//              I *HATE* some songs, and playing them ten times in a row
//              doesn't make me like them any more!

// Example: »My \ is 5" long« becomes »My \\ is 5\" long«
// This can go wrong if there are artists and tracks like this:
// Track "Apple∈Basket" by "Universe" (so "Apple∈Basket∈Universe")
// Track "Apple" by "Basket∈Universe" (so "Apple∈Basket∈Universe", again)
// I hope this is sufficiently unlikely.
