// I created this script because any other Script redirecting to Amazon Smile has one or another flaw
// Most Scripts check for only one TLD like .COM, this script should work for all domains Tampermonkey supports.
// As Amazon redirects its shopping site always to the HTTPS protocol and the WWW subdomain, i only include httpS://WWW.amazon...
// As Amazon prevents to be included in Frames from other sites, i only prevent redirection if the top window is already smile.amazon
// This way i leave (i)frames created by smile.amazon the way Amazon created them, hoping they know what they're doing.

// VERSION 1.1 (13.10.2018)
// It came to my attention that not every Amazon site offers Smile. As far as I found out only .com .de and .co.uk offer Smile.
// I changed the script so Amazon Sites not offering Smile will work with this script.
// VERSION 1.2 (13.10.2018)
// removed unnecessary regex to distinguish between http and https as only https is included
