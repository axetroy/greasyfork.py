/*********************************
 * This script is still experimental. It was adapted by modifying the DCI Hit Monitor script.
* ALERT mode (default) is activated by setting SOUND_DELAY with any positive number greater than zero (2 should be plenty unless speed is limited)
  * best when working this script solely, or have it running in another browser.
  * when an alert pops you stop what you are doing and visit the link from the frozen page
  * it is best to freeze the page using SLEEP_DELAY for a long enough time to investigate the linke
* LINK mode can be activated by setting SOUND_DELAY to 0 (sound delay is not needed in link mode)
  * best when multitasking or if you have a lot of search queries and wish to ignore some alerts
  * the script will continue adding links to the capture page but will not force immediate action
  * you can still set SLEEP_DELAY to give you time to investigate from the search page or set it similar to RELOAD_TIME to keep searching
* 
* To activate this script simply log into your account at https://work.crowdsource.com
  * This script will refresh the page at your specified interval using seach queries reflecting your favorite tasks
*********************************/
//===[Settings]===\\
var RELOAD_TIME = '15';  //==[This is the number of seconds between page reloads. Set to '0' to disable script reloading]
//    * 5 by default - any number above 0 but I have had crowdsource crash on me going too fast. 0 will disable reloading.
var SLEEP_DELAY = '600'; //==[This is the number of seconds HIT monitor waits after a notification]
//    * 15 by default - setting SLEEP_DELAY to 300 will give you five minutes - you can refresh the page manually to start it again sooner
var SOUND_DELAY = '2';  //==[This is the number of seconds the alert waits to give the sound time to load]
//    * prevents the alert from snipping the sound
//    * SOUND_DELAY ALSO SETS ALERT/LINK MODE:
//    * Set to 0 for LINK WINDOW MODE (delay not required for link window)
//    * set to any number above 0 for ALERT MODE (try 2 for normal speed)
var POPUP_WIDTH = '600'; // link page width in pixels
