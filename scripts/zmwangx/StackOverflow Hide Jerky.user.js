// Jerks are everywhere, StackOverflow is no exception. There are idiots who
// wear their political badges everywhere, who take to their SO USERNAMES and
// AVATARS to deliver their crappy political propagenda, and in some cases they
// succeed in distracting me from the programming questions I'm looking at. (I
// don't give a s**t to profiles. It's fine as long as it's out of my way.)
//
// SO moderators keep saying you should report instead of finding a way to
// blacklist. I call bullshit. First, there's no consensus on whether political
// propaganda should or should not be allowed in SO usernames and
// avatars. Secondly, what *I* find annoying or distracting might not be so to
// others, and certainly may not be violating community guidelines (re no
// consensus). Thirdly, arguing with moderators is time consuming, and who
// knows if reporting sensitive matters would lead to retaliation or
// not. Therefore, the perfect solution is to exercise power and judgement on
// the client side, at the cost of some CPU cycles and memory.
//
// This script hides the usernames and avatars of users of your choice from all
// questions, answers, edits, and comments. All content about programming is
// left untouched, so it has minimal side effects on things that you actually
// care about.

// comments on Gists).
